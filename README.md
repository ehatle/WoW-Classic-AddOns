# WoW-Classic-AddOns
Personal addon collection for WoW 1.12

## "Blizz-Feel"
I try to avoid UI overhauls that do not incorporate the classic feel of WoW ("Blizz-feel"). The only addon I personally use that strays from that is Aux, which I begrudgingly use because of its great functionality.

## Fixes
I have implemented some fixes here and there, mainly bugfixes. I primarily play on mac so these bugs are usually left out by the main devs.
