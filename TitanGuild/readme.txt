	- Advanced menus to /w, /invite, /friend or /who guild members
	- Shows default messages if the player is not a member of a guild
	- Updates the guild listing every 5 minutes to accomodate the GuildRoster() delay. The update only takes place if
	  the player is 'idle' and not accessing conflicting UI frames or Titan elements
	- Tooltip and right-click menu content is sortable using the Sort menu option, works like the guild frame
	- Colors rank names (Advanced) or player names (Simple) based on rank index
	- To save space, player can turn off menu options
	- Filtering on a level range and zone, as it relates to the player
	- Filtering on a single class in the player's faction
	- Paging of simple and advanced right-click menu contents to deal with large-guild issues
