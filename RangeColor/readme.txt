In the Configuration menu, you have a Slider with three positions:

Leftmost is 'Hotkey', that will only shade the hotkey.

Rightmost is 'Icon', that will only shade the icon.

And the middle (without name), will shade the icon if there is no hotkey, but if the button has a hotkey
then it will shade the hotkey instead of the icon.


Also you have "Filter" and "Slash" options:
"Filter" will change the text of the hotkey, for example, from "Alt-1" to "A-1".
And "Slash" will change it, form "A-1" to "A1".
